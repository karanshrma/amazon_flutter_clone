## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the backend repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/karanshrma/server.git](https://github.com/karanshrma/server.git)
    cd server
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string and other necessary keys (e.g., JWT secret, port).
4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will typically start on port `3000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

1.  **Clone the frontend repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/karanshrma/amazon_flutter_clone.git](https://github.com/karanshrma/amazon_flutter_clone.git)
    cd amazon_flutter_clone
    ```
2.  **Install Flutter dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
3.  **Update the API URL:**
    Locate the configuration file (e.g., `constants.dart` or similar) in the project and update the base URL to match your running backend server (e.g., `http://<your-ip-address>:3000`).
4.  **Run the app:**
    Connect a device or start an emulator/simulator and run the application.
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
